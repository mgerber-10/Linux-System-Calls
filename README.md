# P1-System-Calls

Added a system-wide process log level attribute to the kernel using three system calls: to "get" the process log level, "set" the process log level, or "add" a message to the kernel log at a defined log level. To invoke the system calls, a static library of functions was created in the user space with harness functions to verify their security.
